Our team is excited to introduce XyberGlaxy, a user-friendly and efficient Computer Retail Management System designed to simplify the online shopping experience for computer products. XyberGlaxy aims to meet the needs of two main user groups: customers who want an easy and enjoyable shopping process, and administrators responsible for smoothly managing products, orders, and promotions.
For our customers, XyberGlaxy will offer secure registration and login, allowing users to create personalized profiles. Customers can effortlessly browse and search through a diverse selection of computers, peripherals, and accessories. With intuitive shopping cart and wishlist features, customers can easily organise and review their selections before making purchases. Additionally, customers will have the opportunity to leave product reviews, track past orders, and take advantage of special discount codes, enhancing their overall shopping experience.
Administrators can easily add, update, or remove items from the inventory. The system will also enable administrators to efficiently track orders, manage promotional discounts. 
XyberGlaxy will be built using fundamental object-oriented programming principles, ensuring a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture.
